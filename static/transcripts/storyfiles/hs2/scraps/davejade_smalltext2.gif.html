<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: the thing is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: being a time guy</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like actually MASTERING time travel</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: im pretty sure what that involves is</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: learning to never use it</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: see its like karate</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: well</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its more like what they SAY about karate</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: that you learn it so you dont use it</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its a god damn no brainer thats what you do with karate</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but see with time travel</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: all the stuff about learning it so you dont have to use it is true</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: theres no good that can come of it</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you can crunch the logic on the loops all you want</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but all youre doing is painting yourself into a corner</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: creating inevitabilities you have to rehearse and enact or face death for yourself or everyone you know</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and sometimes facing death is the very inevitability you have to rehearse</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and then you wait and wait knowing its coming and knowing it has to happen</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: how do you think it made me feel when we were gathering up all those frogs</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and i knew the whole time in a little while you would have to watch me get shot</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but i couldnt say anything or it would mess it all up</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: all cause i thought it would be cool to be marty mcfuckin fly</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but instead of shredding johnny b goode on guitar to get my parents to bang</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: my crowning performance was doing a funny dance while getting pumped full of lead</span>
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">......</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: then i had to leave everyone behind and get into the delorean and return to the 1980s</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but the delorean was actually a big purple moon</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and the 1980s was me accidentally reaching god tier and living on a shitty meteor for a while</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and i guess rose was doc brown</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: doc brown accidentally reached god tier too</span>
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ok i guess this is where the analogy falls apart but you get what i mean</span></div>
