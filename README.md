# MSPA Legacy

MSPA Legacy is a webserver that serves pages from MS Paint Adventures in a format
digestible on older browsers.

MS Paint Adventures is the work of Andrew Hussie, and I am not associated with MS Paint Adventures,
What Pumpkin, VIZ Media, or the Homestuck Independent Creative Union. MSPA To Go is made out of love
for MSPA and a desire for it to be accessible to those using mobile devices.

## Hosting
To host MSPA Legacy, you will need an Apache web server with support for at least PHP 8 (may be 8.1, I'm
not sure) with the cURL plugin.
